<h3> Professor: Carol Hollen </h3>
<h3> Class: Intermediate german (201) </h3>
<h2> Thoughts so far </h2>
    <p> I have had the same professor since freshman year and she is the best professor I could ask for. She tries really hard to help you understand hard concepts in German and is one of the few professors that understand you have more than just that class to deal with. If that was not enough she also gives us extra credit to go to German events, like a German guest speaker. The extra credit comes in really nicely too and I am glad she is one of the professors to give it. Personally, I feel like I have learned a lot in this class, but for others they might feel different. </p>
