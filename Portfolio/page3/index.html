<h2> CSCI at College of Charleston </h2>
    <p> So far at cofc I have had only good experiences with the computer science department. Some courses were pretty hard but the professors were very willing to help you understand it. They also do a good job trying to set you up with internships. Since freshman year I have been doing an internship called igniteCS where you teach computer science to middle school kids. I also discovered I had an interest in animation more than before. Originally I thought I would not be too into it. </p>
