<h3> Professor: Keith Briggs </h3>
<h3> Class: Website Design (CSCI 215)</h3>
<h2> Thoughts so far </h2>
    <p> The professor is pretty cool and so far the class has been pretty good. The early parts were spent on a much needed reminder of HTML and CSS concepts. For this class too he has you use stuff you might have not tried before. He introduced us to Git, GitHub, and WebStorm. He also gives you plenty of time for homework as well which is very nice. Also since this class does not come with a lab attached he has made fridays lab days. At first I thought it would get old really quick but honestly I think the labs help a good bit. I feel like the labs are a good subsititute for having a bunch of homework assignments. </p>
